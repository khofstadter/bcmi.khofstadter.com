Maybe there can be more text with html anchors from the timeline items above.

Testing... ...
<a name="example"></a>
<h5>Example</h5>

<!--


TODO
- best would be if when clicking on the item, the new pop up brings in some info, and in that infor there is a link/anchor to more info;
- https://www.fileformat.info/index.htm for html characters;
- cannot convert to JSON atm, will use CSV file, copy and past from there into script (does not look extactly how it should (some extra spaced_)

- have managed to include vis.js (only html, not md) in jekyll website bcmi.khofstadter.info/timeline.html (todo: use some styling from default css in the vis.js so that they look similar a bit) BUT only working locally: https://github.com/visjs/vis-timeline/issues/179

* link: https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/examples/timeline/items/htmlContents.html
* tooltip when hover: https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/examples/timeline/items/tooltip.html (might not work when using phone)
* select groups:
