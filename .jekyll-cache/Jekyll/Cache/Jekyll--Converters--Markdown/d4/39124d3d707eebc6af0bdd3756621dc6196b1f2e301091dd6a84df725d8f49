In 2018 <a href="https://fredrikolofsson.com/">Fredik Olofsson</a> was added as an external advisor to the supervisory team. He introduced me to GitHub while making a SuperCollider class for the IBVA EEG hardware. Along with others, I have been testing this interface to help find the most suitable EEG for the research and finally decided to pause developing this interface and focus on using the OpenBCI hardware.
