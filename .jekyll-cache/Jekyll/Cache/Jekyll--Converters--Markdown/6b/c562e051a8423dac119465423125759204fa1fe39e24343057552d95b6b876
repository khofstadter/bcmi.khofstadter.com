This project merges the analysis of the two listening studies (<a href="/listening-study-2/">1</a>,<a href="/listening-study-1/">2</a>) and uses <a href="https://rawgraphs.io/">RAWGraphs</a> to produce aesthetically pleasing and meaningful visual representation of data correlations and (possible) causal relations.</p>

<p>The completed project is planned to be published as an academic journal paper related to altered states of consciousness and music.</p>
