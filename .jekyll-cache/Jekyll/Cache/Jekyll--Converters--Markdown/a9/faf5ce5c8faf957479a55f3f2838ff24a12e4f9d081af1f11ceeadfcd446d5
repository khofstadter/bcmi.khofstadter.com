This project developed a software that interfaces NeuroSky EEG headbands with SuperCollider in the context of an audio neurogame. The goal of the project was to create a neurofeedback tool where the audio feedback (rewards) are embedded in an immersive sonic environment which can help facilitate the desired mental shift.</p>
