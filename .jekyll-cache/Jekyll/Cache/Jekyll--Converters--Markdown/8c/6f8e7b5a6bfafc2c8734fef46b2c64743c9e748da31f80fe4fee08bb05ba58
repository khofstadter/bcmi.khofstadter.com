<p>Some shamanic practitioners journey to nonordinary realities with fast and repetitive drumming. As an experiment, the soundscapes on this release extend on these traditional forms. They feature more diverse rhythms, tempo changes, added sound textures and surround sound. The software that generates these soundscapes uses real-time brainwave data with neuro-feedback protocols. The protocols control characteristics of prerecorded and live sounds.
<br /><br />
This release is an outcome of the ‘Brain-Computer Music Interfacing with Meditation’ research. The research investigates how rhythmic entrainment constructs and maintains altered states of consciousness.
<br /><br />
Demonstrating the soundscapes at 2019 Cambridge Festival of Ideas had two main goals. To show how music can help neuro-feedback and to trial the music in group meditation. While performing ‘jester’, the audience was encouraged to meditate with eyes closed. After the performance, some interpreted their ‘visions’ with words and drawings.

Link to the quadraphonic files can be found in the extra downloads, along with the audience drawings and artwork files for the physical release.
