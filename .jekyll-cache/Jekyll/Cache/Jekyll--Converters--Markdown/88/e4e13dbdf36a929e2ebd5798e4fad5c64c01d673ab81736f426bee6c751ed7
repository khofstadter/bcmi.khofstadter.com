Neurofeedback sessions with 3 participants using the OpenBCI-SuperCollider Interface linked to the Shamanic Meditation Soundscape. The goal was to help enhance the power of theta waves at Fz with a specific audio entrainment called rhythmic entrainment. The use of rhythmic entrainment in this project was inspired by the work of Jeff Strong.</p>
