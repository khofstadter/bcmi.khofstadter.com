  <li>
    <p>orientation. What is the interdisciplinary nature of the research?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>why shamanic methods to explore in first BCMI soundscape?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>why are neuromeditation sessions 30-minute long?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what is different between the 30 min tests and this 20 min performance?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>why are the gaming elements absent in this performance?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how shall you listen to the soundscape? Shall you listen to the digital shamans (drums and chakapa), my live drumming or the other sounds?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>shall you watch the screen or not?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how much would you like me to explain before the performance about the mapping between EEG and sounds? If I explain everything, would that affect the way you listen? (Perhaps it won’t help you to let go.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to deepen the meditation, I think you should focus your listening on the static/monotone elements of the soundscape, the digital shaman drumming (speakers).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>eyes closed is preferred, but you can keep it open if you’d like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no intent - no journey :)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>would be great if you can draw your ‘visions’ after the performance.

<h3 id="shamanic-soundscape---level-two">shamanic soundscape - level two</h3>
<p>February 23, 2020
<br />
<br />
Some shamanic practitioners journey to nonordinary realities with fast and repetitive drumming. As an experiment, the soundscapes on this release extend on these traditional forms. They feature more diverse rhythms, tempo changes, added sound textures and surround sound. The software that generates these soundscapes uses real-time brainwave data with neuro-feedback protocols. The protocols control characteristics of prerecorded and live sounds.
<br /><br />
This release is an outcome of the ‘Brain-Computer Music Interfacing with Meditation’ research. The research investigates how rhythmic entrainment constructs and maintains altered states of consciousness.
<br /><br />
Demonstrating the soundscapes at 2019 Cambridge Festival of Ideas had two main goals. To show how music can help neuro-feedback and to trial the music in group meditation. While performing ‘jester’, the audience was encouraged to meditate with eyes closed. After the performance, some interpreted their ‘visions’ with words and drawings.
<br /><br />
Link to the quadraphonic files can be found in the extra downloads, along with the audience drawings and artwork files for the physical release.
