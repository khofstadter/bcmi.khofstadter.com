In 2018 <a href="https://fredrikolofsson.com/">Fredik Olofsson</a> was added as an external advisor to the supervisory team. He introduced me to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> while making a SuperCollider class that acquires raw EEG signals from the 2 channel IBVA (BlueVAS) EEG hardware. I have tested this interface, and other devices e.g. NeuroSky and Emotiv to find the most suitable EEG for the research. This year I decided to pause the development of this interface to be able to focus on developing the <a href="/openbci-supercollider-interface/"><kbd>OpenBCI-SuperCollider</kbd></a> interface with Fredik.</p>
