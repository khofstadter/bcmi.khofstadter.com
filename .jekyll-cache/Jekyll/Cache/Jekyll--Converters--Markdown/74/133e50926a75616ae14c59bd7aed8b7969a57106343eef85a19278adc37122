This project analyses data from two online listening studies (<a href="/listening-study-2/">1</a>, <a href="/listening-study-1/">2</a>) and uses <a href="https://rawgraphs.io/">RAWGraphs</a> to produce aesthetic and meaningful visual representations of the data.</p>

<p>A preliminary analysis of the first listening study will be disclosed in the PhD commentary. The completed project is planned to be published as an academic journal paper related to altered states of consciousness and music.</p>
