thoughts:
## coring + thetaFZ
### soundscape: bcmi01-shamanic-meditation-soundscape + real time drumming
- soundscape guides like a metronome;
- real time drumming follows guide, but also expresses emotions perhaps by bypassing thoughts using words;
- this way, audio recording (generated + mic) can be easily synced to DataRecord;
- maybe surround, probably 2;
- protocol has classified data in fftplot example;
- protocol needs mapping of these class data to sound:
  - class1: (l-r) panning of a sound that indicates which hemishere is more active;
    - more complex idea: all 3 ch on left and all 3 ch on right have their individual sounds somehow changing with their relevant coherence measurements.  sounds could beat at low-beta frequency (somehow synced, perhaps poly-rhytmically to the guide in the soundscape!) than the (l-r) difference could simply adjust volume of these groups;
  - class2: (O1-FZ) if surround is used, perhaps this front-rear coherence could be represented spatially. if stereo

... maybe i should not worry about making sure that feedback on class1, class2 (which is low or high beta related) is represented with high beta related tempes, as the idea here is not that these feedback should help entrain these brain rhythms - or is it?
... perhaps the idea is simply to give some kinda gentle abstract feedback that can be access by the analytical mind if needed.  so, let's try to create something that is **very subtle, abstract.**

- more plotting done: `20201007-bcmi-rec-corin-shamanic`

### 2020 10 01
- have been working on new EEG recordings, each have a separate folder.
- refining corin shamanic NF protocol in SC.  also will add theta FZ to it;
- perhaps later all theta should be added to see not only what is in the corin paper but also what other psychedelic papers indicate: high theta coherence;

### 2020 09 24
- recording, 8ch, no extra data, with jester (binaural): notes + some drawing (Todo: analyse)

### 2020 09 15
- can this be used new year at the Cambridge Festival?
- create a way to use the new shamanic NF protocol with David's piece - 4 channels?;
- need to do some EEG recording for the plotting heading in _project_b_; separated fft plot files in quark, will need to plot with all examples for writeup;
- currently working on _project_b_;
- discussed progress with 1st SV;
- managed to extend the writing up stage again by 6 months, deadline is end of Feb 2021;
- have been focusing on writing up;

### 2020 08 28
- writing b;
- meeting with Paul:
  - to go in commentary (a,b,c with summery of c1,c2,c3 and summery of d, e)
  - to go in book chapter (c1,c2,c3 and their connection to psychedelic music)
  - writing style to be less technical;

### 2020 08 27
- GitHub account for supervisory team;
- invited kh-sv to private repo;

### 2020 08 20-16
- writing b
- trying to find feedback for NF issue in regards to operant conditioning and info on audio programming and mental health;

### 2020 08 10-18
- timetable and bcmi.khofstadter.info website adjustments;
- writing a

### 2020 08 10-13
- regroup projects
- a (conclusion)

### 2020 08 01-09
- writing up, rewriting, etc.

### 2020 07 09-31
- a writing (islet1)
- reorganise projects, think about what should go in commentary and what should go in book chapter;

### 2020 07 09-23
- writing a;
- revised code for a, testing with two headsets;
- asked about extending again (will need supervision as I don't know what's enough)
- reinstalled merge;
- checking code of last focus-neurofeedback and focus-sequencer;

### 2020 07 27-08
- have been writing the commentary: created template for APM framework, focusing on a1 now;

### 2020 06 26
- plotting tests;

### 2020 06 22
- clean local and online repositories;
- reviewed how much is needed for project commentaries;

### 2020 06 15 - 19
- while preprocessing data I also test plotting for ideas;
- preprocess data;
- play with rawgraphs: only 4 steps in flow, maybe extend the svg in AI, where colours could be added as well;

### 2020 06 06
- annotations added to video, re-upload soon;

### 2020 06 04
- video made (explain study and research) - pushed to github;
- post on website made for talking science with survey embedded;

### 2020 06 03
shamanic meditation binaural version: added side-chain (mainly removes the laud sounds from zoom-h1).

![](assets//assets/img//20200501-binauralbeat-setting-in-reaper-5.jpg)


### 2020 06 02
new survey changes: intro.  consent.  shamanic journey question moved to back (to make it sound less ezoteric).  removed focus on the most repetetive parts... (i would like them just to simply listen and let go).  "let it sink inwards. " (from Monroe).  can't change much when embedding into bcmi.khofstater.info website as the inframe is javascript.

### 2020 06 01
- binaural version: 1. tried build in tone generator, it cannot do decimal frequencies; 2. tried RheaSynth, i couldn't figure out how to do freq instea of notes on the MIDI score. 3. tried Vallhalla as one blog says it's cool and psychedelic, but it didn't sound convincing. 4. tried SuperCollider, but I didn't want to save file and then add them to Reaper. 5. ended up usin a free plugin, works:

![](assets//assets/img//20200501-binauralbeat-setting-in-reaper-1.jpg)

- two versions to test: normal (my mix on release) and binaural.
- have been thinking about simplifying talkin science event: new music? would be good, but not enough time.  would have been good to merge focus-synthesiser with bcmi-soundscape-01 shaman sequencer.  too much time.  will have to do later.

### 2020 05 18-26
- march application mistakes:

1. When the co-investigator approached me about a month ago, I thought
she needs help with a project that she wants to write an application
for. Only much later did I realise that she wants me to apply and be a
part of it. I will need to avoid ambiguity in the future.

2. I drafted timelines with £15.38 per hour for myself and the
co-investigator in the first two drafts. (I got this figure from the
internet!) Only this week did I realise that the rate is much higher:
£25.16 per hour for me and around the same for the co-investigator as
she would have been employed through our employment bureau. This meant
that my plans were over the 20K budget.

### 2020 05 18
- interpret values in cvs with the actual survey e.g. 0-100 focused-not focused, etc.

### 2020 05 14
https://app.rawgraphs.io/
- merge eng and hun
- maybe remove open ended questions?
- maybe export with numbers instead of strings (as well);
- they need manual editing;
- simplifying: Spirituality: Nature, Spirit, Pagan
- consistency: Christian > Christianity;
- translate from hun to eng;
- remove duplicates - perhaps software issue;
- remove k - create new file for them;

### 2020 05 13
- todo:
  - need to merge hun and eng and expreriment with plotting;
  - what is most important to know?
  - how important are collectors?
- experimenting with https://rawgraphs.io/
- all data from surveymonkey download in as many formats as possible (not SPSS)

### 2020 05 08
- migrating tasks from this file to commentary;
- first commentary draft sent to supervisors;
- thinking about MARCH funding with Marcy;

### 2020 03 - 2020 05

- Science Festival cancelled > thinking about something online;
- pandemic: applied for intermitting;
- writing up
  - sum notes in last notebook and start new note book;
  - need to extend the exploritary LitRev as I was reading general stuff much longer. Perhaps focused could start where NeuroFeedback and Strong was discovered. The Refined is when checking shamanism with EEG, spirits, etc.
  - each project, chapter should be illustrated with some drawing - this I could start making in the new notebook, then design in illustrator. Having these drawings will help writing about the projects.


### wc. 2020 03 15
- CDs arrived:

![](assets//assets/img//20200318-shamanic-soundscape-cd.JPG)

- conversations with Collura;
- have been finding it difficult to work due to COVID

### wc. 2020 03 09
- issue with printing has to do with RGB to CYMK conversion, so used Photoshop to convert GIMP project and experted pdf for 4th proof.

### wc. 2020 03 02
- writing;
- 3rd proof for CD hasn't got the right colour:

![3 proofs](assets//assets/img//20200304-shamanic-soundscape-3rd-proof.jpg)

### 2020 02 28
- learnt the difference between duplication (CD-R) and replication (normal) - is it worth replicating? 500 min.

### 2020 02 22-26
- new shamanic paper (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049360) also indicates lower left brain activity;
- writing commentary: methodology needs help from timeline, timeline helps methodology and will help lit.rev;
- idea of adding wim hof practice to commentary as it should be tested with eeg as well (how long have I been doing it? do I really think it is better then what I do - well, it's different, relaxation, focus is achieved faster, but with the shamanic journeying I get deeper)
- subtracting in the outside word help, for instance trimming the trees in the garden;

### 2020 02 22
- arwork for physical copy adjusted, asked for new proof;

### 2020 02 21
- finished 'playing' quad mix;
- registered to quadraphonic forum;

### 2020 02 20
- bmk analysis;
- waiting for CD example;

### 2020 02 19
- bmk (plotted again, exported level data, merged questionars in one spreedsheet)

### 2020 02 18
- shamanic protocol cap draft incorporates as much as possible from:
	- Jeff Strong (shamanic journey starts with alpha peak, if you are experienced, there is also higher theta activity, theta increases with drumming at 4 bps in shamanic journeying, also increase delta, complexity increases gamma activity, the basetones can also be seen in the raw data)
	- TM: front and back synchronised (high alpha)
	- Jovanov and Maxfiled - total theta band power gradual increas in 20 min;
	- NeuroMeditation: Quiet Mind needs Pz (alpha increase)
	- NeuroMeditation: Mindfulness (1) Thoughtless Awareness (FZ - increase fmTheta; PZ - decrease Gamma)

- release artwork (based on SHAMAN journal) - considering CD (again);

### 2020 02 11
- Fredrik adds new feature to fft plot example;
- searching shaman papers
- meeting with Ian, discussing plan for new shamanic neuro-feedback;

### 2020 02 10
- finding it difficult to get back into the tasks.  trying music.  maybe only breathing helps.

### 2020 02 07
- 4 channel mix in Reaper, tricky: https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=231260

### 2020 02 06
Neurophysiological markers ub diverse trance states including yoga and shamanic practices; Zen Buddhist and transcendental meditation; psychedelic experiences as- sociated with hallucinogenic drugs; mediumship/psychography; hypnosis; and shamanic states. These include:
- shift towards right hemisphere
- greater alpha and anterior–posteriorsyn- synchronisation
- increase theta power and and short, synchronous bursts of high-voltage theta waves (4–7 Hz)
- Increased gamma power
- Synchronization of EEG activity between left and right frontal lobes, which may be accompa- nied by progressive frontal hypoactivation in deeper forms of trance

qEEG in the study:
- In the trance state, the subject shows reduced coherence in the right hemisphere and increased coherence in the left hemisphere in the low beta band compared to the controls
- In the high beta band, the pattern is of increased anterior–posterior coherence;
- Of particular interest is the presence of two symmetrical foci of increased power bilaterally in the centro-temporal regions, which is completely absent in the control condition (for this I would need to remove REF from C and use electrodes next to ear. )



### 2020 02 04-05
- papers on meditation, shamanic journeying with EEG;

### 2020 02 03
- 2nd phase coherence added, pushed to repo;
- testing Monolit with breathing exercises and two phase coherence measurements: some ideas, would be good to plot raw EEG as well, but then how do I scroll in, perhaps the idea is to plot only parts of the the whole recording.  make sure you check the volume level before listening, try to have files used on the Desktop, etc. the EEG will need to be checked further in SC or (and) Matlab;
- TM research: it is based on alpha, coherence, etc. (needs to be refines: https://theleadersbrain.org/about.html), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYZM3-09ySE

### 2020 02 02
- last round of personal dissemination

### 2020 01 31
- TM (object referral vs self referral), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgXUxQJcmFw
- local coherence (https://youtu.be/eGijME2caEM?t=268) and global coherence;
- syncing front of the brain (CEO) and back of the brain (world) is good;
- first create local coherence then global
(https://theleadersbrain.org/about.html)
- threshold calculation in bcmi-soundscap plotter not correct, perhaps issue is in soundscape code- check!

### 2020 01 30
- conversation with peter about a possible collaboration;
- open-bci-supercollider/plotter_example.scd plots raw data;
- involvement in xenophobe comment on corona virus, chinese people - applied method, FFR, post then taken down;
- developed the idea for the artwork SM-L2;

### 2020 01 29
- test Monolit with EEG (impedance, start EEG, wim hof breathing, music in VLC, impedance), interrupted, so need to reschedule test.  asked nimetu to provide his own breathing techniques.

### 2020 01 28
- refinement of bcmi-soundscape-01 (plotter and main)

### 2020 01 27
- release: shamanic soundscape - level two; artwork template cannot be run in GIMP, downloading Krita to format file
- plotter in bcmi-soundscape-01 is working, but needs refinements;

### 2020 01 24
- mixing tutorial with Mat. Managed to make fx louder by lowering the vol. of rear channels (3-4). Dum is also tighter due to the wider eq cut. One remaining issue to address now the bass sound is not bassy enough sometimes (~17:20Ö - now addressed with adjusting compression and EG. Listened two two examples, OK. Ready to upload to Bandcamp. Bandcamp upload limit sorted out with purchasing own music. Uploading and naming the album 'shamanic soundscape - l.2' (as this is the missing level) - need work on artwork for digipack

### 2020 01 23
- 8ch coherence code added to repo
- experimenting with bcmi-soundscape-01 plotting (new format, new file needed, it does not seem to plot unfinished soundscapes, ... )
- merged types (test & performance) - started working on flexible code for 2-4ch differences;

### 2020 01 22
- decided to merge nf-test and performance code for repo;
- refined bcmi-soundscape-01

### 2020 01 20-21
- supercollider work on bcmi-soundscape-01 repo

### 2020 01 14-20
- dissemination on FB

### 2020 01 10
- mixing in reaper - two things to look at:
1. tighter bass;
2. louder effects without changing drum sounds (how!?)
- testing fredrik's sound player;
- contacting shaman group admins;


### 2020 01 08
- asked for feedback on hungarian survey, joined two facebook group;
- what are the most difficult parts: analyse EEG data, rewrite thesis, read more EEG, code coherence test for two EEGs

### 2020 01 07
Máté Imre riport (Yotengrit) 2. rész
- rábaközi tudó emberek nem használtak drogokat, értelmetlen szavakat ismételtek, ettől estek transzba.

### 2020 01 06
- due to 'popular demand', the 'shamanic meditation' survey is translated to hungarian, currently being checked;

### 2019 12 17
- mixing in studio: some effect sounds are missing with the 4 to 2 channel VSTs (ReaSurround, ATK decoders), have experimented with binaural as well, conclusion: to achieve a similar mix to Mat's, I need to use the classic render again: frontL + rearL, frontR+rearR;

### 2019 12 15
shamanic journey
- i don't think it is very important to have a question;
- more open way of communicating with our inner wisdom;
- is it important to start visualising the environment at the beginning, while relaxing in the beginning.
- the word 'inspired' - inspiration - you and spirit (you are in the spirit)
- the intelectual part needs to take part but more as vitnes, rather then something in control.
- ? inside/outside inspiration ? can it come from the outside? !!!
- length: short if it is a specific questions, longer for information;
- callback: thanks the spirit;


### 2019 12 13
- sc plotting performance
- realised that forest.scd level (14,16) mistake has effected the soundscape as well - voice for level 2 is missing - is this really a problem?  turn it into an opportunity! it was gone in another universe - haha = again, a unique thing, that helps to stay awake!

### 2019 12 10
- more survey dissemination and personal messages (issue with survey not submitting on Safari);
- will stick to plotting as it is, not looking into other ways, still issues:

![cased by bad code](assets//assets/img//20191210-plotting01.jpg)

![level number manual change](assets//assets/img//2019-12-10-bbedit-import-raw-eeg-2.jpg)

- but most look OK:

![most](assets//assets/img//20191210-plotting02.jpg)

### 2019 12 06-09
- spotted mistake in 'forest' files, levels numbers were not saved correctly; files in all projects ameneded;
- raw files need to be changed manually in the last level - should be done with fine/replace in BBEdit:


![forest level mistake](assets//assets/img//20191209-forest-level-saved-incorrectly.jpg)


- issues with survey, not submitted (earlier not working on some browsers)

### 2019 12 05
- getting an extension might be more difficult than thought;

### 2019 12 04
- refining plotting in sc;

### 2019 12 03
- plotting date in sc; there is an issue with some of the files and a routine that downscales info. plotting works, but there is an error message;
- raw text file amendments (for now removing '['s is enough) :
	- using BBEdit_12.6.7 (see updated workflow below)
- survey dissemination

### 2019 12 02
- more discemination of survey via emails and new traditional shamanism facebook group;
- looking at Will's Matlab script;

### 2019 11 29
- meeting with Martin and co. (survey feedback) and Alex;
- meetin with Will and Szilvia (Matlab learning)
- mixing with Matt (needs more time, there seem to be differences between software)

### 2019 11 27-28
- more posters in Essex;
- followup email to CFI event bookers (through David C.)

### 2019 11 26
- update on sc forum - phase coherence;
- migrate mix settings from protools to reaper - not good sound;
- dissemination of survey link;

### 2019 11 25
- tunnelblink vpn not working out today;
- communicating with shamanism group admin about issues related to posting/commenting with external link;
- uploading paintings to earn trust of facebook shamanism group;
- difficulties with sending out more messages on FB to people I am not friends with;
- uploading painting to khofstadter.info and linking to shamanism group;
- more dissemination via facebook messages and email (asked Shamanism group admin to allow messaging group members privately);
- testing tunnelblink and sc messaging between uk-germany with fredrik

### 2019 11 22
- meeting with india and invitation to talk in london
- meeting with g and nick (surprise) - discussing shadow and general things;
- poster printed (bit cut off!) - some put out;
- sc: communication between berlin-cambridge via sc tested;

### 2019 11 21
- difficulties with obtaining rights to use the original version of the shaman image;
- Mat sends details for mix (probably need to do together at one point);
- survey final - disseminated via Facebook post (+tags), psy music group,
- survey changes based on FSS feedback.

### 2019 11 20
- checking Mat's mix, asking for plugin setups so I can duplicate for other recordings and experiment further with binaural for this recording;
- survey amendments: making arousal-valance map in Ilustrator (Gimp would be the choice- but can work faster in AI atm).
-

### 2019 11 19
- mix back from Mat, very good, perhaps bass from sc file needs to be more centred;
- phase syncronisation in sc;
- editing in Premier;
- survey amendments (remove file upload as too expensive), add setting conditions, emphasise question making;

### 2019 11 18
- phase syncronisation in sc;
- discussing website submission with doctoral school;

### 2019 11 15-17
- working on shamanic meditation survey: received feedback from shamanic fb group, 2nd supervisor, waiting for Gavin and FSS;

### 2019 11 09-14
- discussing mix of FI performance with Matt Skitmore;

### 2019 11 09-13
- working on shamanic soundscape survey;

### 2019 11 09-12
- added more data to timeline;
-  Will sent some Matlab code for theta plotting;
- marcy, what carrier freq. to use in survery for BB version?
- CD samples ordered for shamanic soundscape physical copy (the idea is to gain interest by telling people that their artwork will go on the CD artwork and the website - free advertisment);

### 2019 11 09-11
- investigating options for vis.js to be used for phd timeline, narrowd workflow done;

### 2019 11 09-10
- investigating alternatives to Premier for video editing. Blender is fast, but could not work out right video format and it takes time to learn (later). iMovie only has two video channels. Screenflow for editing this large multi cam project is too slow.

### 2019 11 07-08
- listening to Cave and Cosmos (good if your eyes are tired)
- mixing three performances in Reaper;
- working on phase coherance code;
- creating interest in drawing after shamanic journeying (facebook group);

### 2019 11 05
- demo at ARU, music students, recorded music;
- 30min setup is tight;

### 2019 11 04
- bennie and ivan asked about new S3 corrosion
- survey issue - how do people attache their /assets/img/? Can they get an ID after the survey that they can refer to?
- prep for Wed 6 Nov ARU demo (tripods, tech, ..)

### 2019 11 03
- reply from JH on SC forum re phase coherence;

### 2019 10 30

- final coding to use phase sync in performance;
- setup for demo/performance;

### 2019 10 21
- 4 channel at home + 1 live (instead of SM57 Zoom H1 is used);

### 2019 10 19
- feedback on coherance on openbci forum;

### 2019 10 18
- experimenting with code;
- - Ian has introduced some functions in Matlab (some his, some from BioSig);

### w.c. 2019 10 07
- having difficulties with reading raw file in matlab;
- playing back sc raw files with added data is OK in openbci 4.1.3;

### w.c. 2019 10 03

how to amend the raw files? We need to amend the raw files as some softare does not like the extra '[' characters. Also, I was thinking of adding the thresholds (theta, gamma) the the raw file, however these values were only changed ones at the beginning and remained the same throughout - so no real need to keep them in the files. Later, once there is an automatic thresholding code, these threshold values should be recorded in the raw file as well.

- amending raw eeg text files in OpenOffice (if addition is needed)
	1. drag & drop raw eeg text file on an emtpy spreed sheet in open office with the following settings:
![title](assets//assets/img//2019-10-03-openoffice-import-raw-eeg-1.jpg)

	2. add column where needed
	3. fill in column info (watch video)
	4. remove [ and ]
	5. add ` '` where needed with find & replace ([help](https://forum.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?t=26830))

	![title](assets//assets/img//2019-10-03-openoffice-import-raw-eeg-2.jpg)

	6. don't save as other format, save as current format.
	7. make sure header is exaclty the same as before (remove extra commas)
	7. check with eye some rows.
	8. check back in sc...

- if we only need to remove:
	- amending files in Atom is very slow:

![title](assets//assets/img//2019-10-03-atom-import-raw-eeg.jpg)


	- amending files in BBEdit (TextWrangler) is superfast;

![title](assets//assets/img//2019-10-03-bbedit-import-raw-eeg-1.jpg)

- final:

	- nominating ex. sup. - call Brigitta;
- working on timer/reward/soundscape in sc;

### w.c. 2019 09 02
- help for reaper file [organising](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=2178859)
- have been working on the sequencer mainly in sc;

### w.c. 2019 08 26
- consulted sc forum for paradiddle code and started working on it;
- asked mathematics.stackoverflow for guidence on mathematics used (nor answer)

BABA01 (pretest)
- no questionaire, i kinda know what he is like, he touched the eeg while tests, he couldn't concertrate on the drumming (maybe needs to be made more explicit, maybe 30 min of the most minimal shamanic drumming is to much if they are not interested in this, he asked about the smudge scent, he was told it will be max 1h with some sounds, i don't think he was focusing on the music, do people actually want to change something in them (differentiate between people who like the idea and and the ones who don't seem to be interested), after 15 minutes he was told to focus on the breething and the music (as he was not focusing on anything really, he was looking at the fft plot often, he is clever, wanted to understand (maybe we need to make sure people understand the agenda >> you will understand if you let go of understanding, there were small noises from the outside, after the test he said he was not tired when we started (altough was jawning constantly), he said he only got tired towards the very end, he said he could differentiate between the wide and the narrow sound (probably different timbre)

### 2019 08 18, 19

3. started: [Beginners guide to the Frame Drum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuzrQKUyzKQ) by Pete Lockett

### 2019 07 19
1. have been communication with Ivan about the S3 and other NF related issues.
2. S3 is on the way from China;
3. managed to make a subclass of DataRecord.sc;
4. emailed Clemens the raw file to test in Matlab;
5. replied to Andrej
6. suggesting Goldsmith music&mind Msc to choose 2nd supervisor from;
7. made a screenrecording with eeg and frame drum, asked Clemens to check it, I am looking for artifacts induced by drumming (movement) and increased theta and gamma;
8. i have requested Matlab to be on my computer;


### 2019 07 18
1. experiment with last studio recording's phase;
2. open_bci gui issues (impedence)
3. sc - experimenting with sc DataRecord - trying to write a class;
4. got in touch with hemi-sync about metamusic.  how to make music for them?  checking their store (https://hemi-sync.com/): andrej hrvatin is very interesting: https://hemi-sync.com/product/heros-journey/; https://nimetu.org/shamanic-drumming-the-percussionists-perspective/ - the idea is to make minimal dub techno style that is not pre composed but with their guidence;
5. andrej hrvatin. breathe in breathe out performs in the dark - sent him an email, he sent a long reply;

### 2019 07 17
1. 3d printing of raised encloser
2. studio recording aru frame drum (no pulse, freestyle, AKG414 and SM57, + binaural with Zoom, some iphone video recordings):
	- not really good music, recordings might be good;
	- needs to practiec meditation to be able to focus and stay a bit more repetetive, at the moment the music is too random, thoughts are not settled, so this is probably a good representation of a not focused mind;
	- information on phase issues: https://www.uaudio.com/blog/understanding-audio-phase; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXQcjaXnhG0, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH0ByODyd3o

### 2019 07 16
- testing wifi in openbci-gui, jumps without filters as well: probably a programming issue;
- testing sc fft plot with 'first trip' music, also tested dataRecord and playback, matching screen recording, all good.

### 2019 07 11
- double checking that signal is OK or not in openbci gui, AND it is not OK.  so problem is not in sc code;
- fine tuned wifi-setup when firmware updates: no need to remove the shield from the cyton;

### 2019 07 10
- openbci_gui test for github issue;
- openbci_sc_wifi_still_jumping;

### 2019 07 09
- rewrote fftplot sound example code, now thresholds seems to work again;
- learnt some tinkercad to amend some openbci enclosers, hope to print next week;

### 2019 07 08
learnt:
- lanscan needs to be restarted when new scanning;
- serial communication works, when having wifi shield on:
1. make sure wifi shield has osc firmware and is paired to linksys (no need to take wifi shield off the openbci board, just make sure the external switch is powered off; after pairing Lanscan needs to see it (if it was running before, Lanscan needs restarting);
2. serial in openbci_gui (check impedence)
3. serial in supercollider
4. wifi in supercollider

### 2019 07 05
- wifi shield firmware setup for open_bci_gui, working with linksys modem;
- signal in open_bci_gui not jumping;

### 2019 07 04
- soldering antenna, working;

### 2019 07 02

- tested wifi shield jumping signal again, and broke the antenna off;
- tested impedance measurements in sc:
? ask openbci forum;

### 2019 07 01
- added more salt in the water, earlier it was much less;
- tested more salt, maybe better, not sure;
- impedence test in sc - not sure how it works;
? is there a way to continuously monitor impedence and save in a file with eeg data?
- wifi shield tested again - data jumping;

### 2019 06 28
1. test default Wifi firmware (2.0.5) with OpenBCIGUI (OpenBCI_GUI-v4.1.0-beta.1);
- test eeg with serial - all good;
- test eeg with wifi - could not connect;
2. test custom OSC Wifi firmware with sc;
- test f's code - in relevant youtube video;
3. organising faq;
4. getting in touch with Greentek - no reply;

### 2019 06 26
buy new EEG cap.
	- get in touch with people who bought the S3 cap;
	- get touch on skype with Greentek
		- is Bennie still there?
		- can they still do the same deal or perhaps cheaper?
		- why did you go back to not sintered electrodes with this cap?

### 2019 06 26
- IP is mine - confirmed by ARU;
- IADS sounds enquiry sent to Emily;

### 2019 06 25
- broken antenna on RDF chip re-soldered, maybe only 3 legs, not lost packages in sc;
? clearing both electrodes, cap?
? how does low battery effect the signal?

### 2019 06 24
Testing Jumping signal:
- little thing that broke off might be the issue, but why would this effect the wifi signal?
- was the wifi working properly after the AES talk, did I use it after the AES talk?
- there are little green corrosions in the electrode base (rost?);
todo:
- need to check whether wifiOSC was ever working in sc?
- put OpenBCI's firmware back on wifi (original) to test wifi in OpenBCI GUI;
- talk to Istvan about healing the cap;
- buy a new cap;
- is there a gel cap in the Music Therepy clinic that I could borrow?

### 2019 06 21
- testing with distilled water, no difference to jumping signal in Wifi;
- little thing broke off the OpenBCI board (next to RFD chip);
conlusion:
- wifi is worse than serial, why?
- new electrodes better than old ones;
- is the wifi shield damaged as well?

### 2019 06 20
- testing wifi/sc with cap: couldn't get good signal in sc in 2 hours;
- meeting with Ian;

### 2019 06 19
Questions for Ian:
- how many samples do I need?
- is it a good idea to record two people simultaneously?
- what does he think about the soundscape ideas?
- what does he think about the NeuroMeditation protocols? which one could be used best with which soundscape?
- demo in September in Hex?
- y cable;
- feeltrace (trackball mouse) vs accelerometer (not on head?)

### 2019 16 17
- organise thoughts;
- drive: after phd (dmt);

#### 2019 06 11-13
* aphorisms prep/concert
* no EEG used;

#### 2019 06 10
- compose two soundscapes with tibetan bowls and the idea of EEG
- read 'An electro-acoustic implementation ofTibetan bowls: Acoustics and perception'
- purchased a Kontakt sample pack;
- http://musicproductionhq.com/tibetan-singing-bowl/

#### 2019 06 05
- whole day in the recital hall, tested mixer, busing of quad speaker setup;
- changed a few things in the SuperCollider code: now with a function the Ndef stops when the loop gets to the end;

#### 2019 06 05
- brief from David received, I am expected to trigger sound samples throughout the concert. I probably need to make some of these sounds and bounce them as mono wave files. I am also probably live sound engineer. This means I have to touch the computer often and have more responsibilities than expected. Due to this I was suggested to consider ditching the EEG idea for another time. This suggestion is reasonable, however changes the whole method needed. I am still prepared to carry on using SuperCollider so at the moment (with Fredrik's) help I am trying to refine how to use Ndef to trigger and free sound samples. I also would like
- to carry on using 4 speakers;
- feed in the life sound from the mixer and process it;
- perhaps use a nano controller;

#### 2019 06 04
- thinking about having a static composition on a separate player feed in the mixer (SC on the top);
- moving into JITLib with Fredrik's guidance;

#### 2019 06 03
Aphorisms
- based on Eli's [SuperCollider Tutorial: 20. Microphones and SoundIn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vu4UbS2NMw), a SoundIn Synth draft with delay was made;
	- todo: check Bus/Grouping related tutorial to have control over modules e.g. delay;

#### 2019 05 31
Aphorisms:
- 3 short voice samples selected and repaired in RX: 	- Mouth De-click:
	- De-click (if anything left to remove);
	- De-ess
	- De-plosive
	- Direct Sample Editing (if needed)

![remove low frequency rumble](assets//assets/img//2019-05-31-aphorism-RX-manual.jpg)

- - EQ to remove low freq artifact (if needed)

![remove low frequency rumble](assets//assets/img//2019-05-31-aphorism-RX-remove-low-freq-artifact.jpg)

-
	- EQ (remove low energy from 45Hz)

#### 2019 05 28
- Skype with David (1h);

#### 2019 05 24
- new Pulse is sent;
- working on Exodus (include methodology/plan) in thesis;

### 2019 05 23
Studio recording with Pulse and Frame Drum
- even with two sound proofing foam, the pulse is too loud in the recordings;
- it is ver difficult (for me) to follow the metronome (the pulse) and dive into an improvisation: not good recordings;
- the binaural recordings with the Roland didn't work out as we couldn't connect both sides of the headphones to the sound card;

### 2019 05 10
Rehearsing Aphorisms in Recital Hall:
- Wireless Router cannot be next to the wall.
- Frame drum might not work here with the style;
- tried REF on ear, seems to work;
- question: what sounds, when?

### 2019 02 01

- conversations about corrosion on EEG electrodes;
- checking forum and github issues;
- tested impedance with openbci_gui and greentek, i expected a difference between the electrode heads with the black flap and the once which seem to look brand new with the silver part, but after having experimented for a while, they delivered similar results. now.
	- I move the reference electrode back to REF from CZ, and it seemed to reduce the impedance (WHY?);
	- let's try brand new sponges;
	- let's check the water, i've used normal water;

### 2019 01 31
- tested new softAP from Fredrik, doesn’t seem to be usable as there are too many lost packages;
- tested new OpenBCI_GUI for [impedance issue](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_GUI/issues/427), they updated it, now it work.
- there might be a problem with [EEG corrosion](assets//assets/img//2019-01-31-eeg-corrosion.JPG), hence the high impedance I've been measuring;

### 2019 01 30
- firmware [update](assets//assets/img//2019-01-30-openbci-wifi-shield-update.JPG) with FTDI cable, quark update - test;

- fresh Sierra install;
- following Fredik’s Wifi install guide:
- uploading basic firmware in programming mode;
- had slight issue with connecting wifi shield to home wifi/computer wifi (wifi manager) solution might be to get close to the router;
now sc streams data from wifi;

### 2019 01 24-25
- Fredrik shared info on how to setup the Wifi OSC;
- needs testing;

### 2019 01 27-28
- installed Mojave next to Safari, same problem;
- the impedance issue with the GUI has been attended, now I need to test it:
- https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_GUI/issues/427#issuecomment-457956993.
- no answer for the FTDI question yet.

### 2019 01 21

- asked questions:
	- https://openbci.com/index.php/forum/#/discussion/1960/which-osx-and-ftdi-version-is-best-to-use-with-the-standalone-openbci-gui
	- https://openbci.com/index.php/forum/#/discussion/1961/impedance-measuring-issue-with-openbci-gui-4-0-3-standalone-osx

- reorganised literature folders and BookEnds ref to files;

### 2019 01 10
* changed REF from REF to Cz after talking to William Croft:
http://openbci.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/1663/greentek-gelfree-s-eeg-cap#latest
* need to find a way to use ear-clips for REF with y cable;
* experimented with positioning the board and cables next to me on a chair to reduce 50hz noise and reduce impedance: all worked out;
* for the last few weeks I have been pre-soaking the electrode shells and sponges for around 30 mintutes, when I add them to the cap, they are very wet - seems to help;

earlier outcomes on the [project website](https://bcmi.khofstadter.info)

### 2017 09
- Fredrik stars getting involved in the project, he is helping with firmware updates and ideas on how to send EEG from OpenBCI to SuperCollider;

- algorithmic/random (always changing). the buddhist idea of destroying/erasing the artwork.  to keep in mind that it's temporary.
- how does 'playing' with the boundaries/limits/opposites help understanding.  what is 'understanding'

### 2016 02
- how to connect Blofeld synth to EEG
- ! "maybe there is no challenge to complete on a timescale within to make music that can earn NF points - this would be passive BCI"

### 2016 01 29
- how could i sonify/musify the water around the islets?  also, perhaps the top of the islet (the land) has another sound as the bottom (the one underneath the water) - why is this important?

#### Guide to Brain-Computer Music Interfacing

**Brain–Computer Music Interfacing: Interdisciplinary Research at the Crossroads of Music, Science and BiomedicalEngineering**
(Eduardo Reck Miranda)
- 3 challenges of BCMI
  1. extracting meaningful control information from EEG
	2. design of effective generative music techniques
	3. improve people's lives
- soft BCI vs hard BCI:
  - soft: the music system reacts to the mental system
  - hard: voluntary control of music (inc. learning and ability):
  	- consious effort (1) e.g. congnitive task (imagining moving of limbs)
  	- operant conditioning (2)
- types of analysis: FFT, Hjörth
- moving forward:
  1. discovering meaningful musical information
  2. powerful musical systems which engage researcher

**Electroencephalogram-based Brain–Computer Interface: An Introduction**
(Ramaswamy Palaniappan)

- EED data acquisition -> noise reduction -> feature extraction -> classification -> device commands (spec. for applications)
- types of BCI (to add)

**Contemporary Approaches to Music BCI Using P300 Event Related Potentials** (Mick Grierson and Chris Kiefer)
- P300, ERP vs NFT (accuracy?)
Väljamäe et al: - the mapping strategy depends on the application, mapping does not mirror strict semiotic relations (meanin making)

**Prospective View on Sound Synthesis BCI Control in Light of Two Paradigms of Cognitive Neuroscience** (Mitsuko Aramaki et al.)
- ambigious sounds have a slover reaction time in the ERP and the are more negative
- different ERP for metal, glass and wood sounds
- BCI uses: 1) unhealthy (rehabilitation, reducing disability, impove quality of life physically disabled), 2) healthy (increase the realism of games (REF)
- types: 1) explicit (do we have to learn new ways of thinking to control BCI or do we have to find out how to see our thoughts in the EEG, maybe both?  is this in line with brain plasticity); 2) implicit BCI (does not require learning period - hypothetical)
- ! "any kind of feedback cannot be used, but only those with the desired effect on the brain and the cognitive activity..." p.81

**Machine Learning to Identify Neural Correlates of Music and Emotions** (Ian Daly et al.)
- learning the regulatory of patterns;
- types of analysis: amplitude (ERP, peak latency, zero crossing), freq. domain (bandpower-FFT, power spectral density (PSD), phase (syncronisation, complex networks), combinatorial (hybrid of all)

 **Emotional Responses During Music Listening** (Konstantinos Trochidis and Emmanuel Bigand)

1. discrete/categorical model, universal emotions (GEMS: genova emotions music scale)
2. dimensional model
3. ...

The role of musical structures on emotions: Effect of mode and tempo (major/minor/fast/slow) - difference in frontal lobe

**A Tutorial on EEG Signal-processing Techniques for Mental-state Recognition in Brain–Computer Interfaces** (Fabien Lotte)

- check this again;

**On Mapping EEG Information into Music** (Joel Eaton and Eduardo Reck Miranda)
- BCMI will benefit music therapy;
- Miranda's categorisation for s:

1. user oriented systems (goal is to understand the meaning of user input e.g. R. Teitelbaum 'In Tune')
2. computer oriented systems (NF, the user has to learn how to perform e.g 'Music for Sleeping and Waking... ')
3. mutually oriented systems (1. the system learns EEG behaviour, ... check again.

- methods for music generation with EEG:
1. EEG sonification (transformation of EEG information into sound for non musical, predominantly medicinal purposes - sound is relative to itself, hearing numerical or graphical data)
2. EEG musification (mapping EEG to organised musical parameters - loose forms of control)
3. BCI control (real time cognitive control of music is achievable)

**Creative Music Neurotechnology with Symphony of Minds Listening** (Eduardo Reck Miranda, Dan Lloyd, Zoran Josipovic and Duncan Williams)
- hypothesis: If we understnd how music affects the mind, we can compose better music.
- everyone's brain is different, therefore it's difficult to have a common ground.
- is the mind seperate from the brian?
- does every brain constract music differently?

**Passive Brain–Computer Interfaces** (George and Anatole Lécuyer)
- passive (user doesn't try to control) vs active BCI (deliberate change)
