# Antony Storr: Music and the Mind
Antony Storr, 1992. *Music and the Mind*. The Free Press

**Scope**: "primarily concerned with classical or Western 'art' music, rather than popular music." [p.xi] "This book is an exploratory search; an attempt to discover what it is about music that so profoundly affects us, and why it is such an important part of our culture." [p.xxi]

## I. Origins and Collective Functions

The **function of art** is biological (if any given activity can be seen to aid survival). An example is early *drawings* in caves helping the 'artist' to sharpen perception i.e. to know the pray better. The function of *storytelling* (the origin of literature) is not (was not) primarily for entertainment, but for sharing, passing down tradition i.e. knowledge. When we want to find out what music is, we could start at asking what the origin of music is and/or what functions it has for us (humans). 

- researches couldn't agree (yet) on an origin, there is debate; 
- they agree that music is only remotely related to sounds and rhythms in nature; 
- many musicians have given up to try defining what music is; 

### Some theories/thoughts
(there is more in the book)

"... the singing voice has a greater carrying power than the speaking voice (Révész Géza), hence, the function of music is to carry emotion. Emotions are complex sets of information about an emotional state. Music is sounds with emotional content. [p11]

k: *What are emotions?*

"Poetry proper is never merely a higher mode (melos) of everyday language. It is rather the reverse: everyday language is forgotten and therefore used-up poem, from which there hardly resounds a call any longer (Heidegger)" [p13] 

Things (objects) are labeled with symbols (words/sound).   
Poetry/music is a set of organised symbols. 

**The evolution of describing things:**    
First, we (caveman) explained in terms of our own subjective, physical experience, later, (more intelligent men) can be more objective, scientific. 

k: It feels like emotional (subjective) expressions came first and later we were able to express ourselves more objectively. Is this parallel with how we as children are more subjective and can be more objective as we are getting older (and wiser)?

"The objective language generally used by scientists and philosophers, which is concerned with conceptual thought and with demonstrations and proof rather than with evocation, and which usually avoids metaphor as far as possible, is quite different from the musical language used by poets, by the pre-literate, or even by those who are not highly educated in the Western tradition. 'The magnet loves iron' is not scientific explanation of magnetism, but is a naturally anthropomorphic way of speaking found in the world over." [p13]

k: The use of words has something to do with our bodies: warm, cold, love, ... ?

### Speech and music, which was first? 
An idea:

1. music and speech were once the 'same' - closely joined; 
2. their development split;
3. music articulates mainly by pitch and duration;
4. language articulates mainly rational thought; 
5. music uses a symbolic language; 

k: Subjective expressions for the individual are more important than expressions of objective ideas (biologicall I guess). Do we all start being very subjective when we are kids and then can be more objective via learning, exposing ourselves to other perspectives? (If the ego is subjective, becoming more objective might be a way of getting rid of the ego > this might be a journey from focus to mindfulness and later to transcendence.) Are we as kids very connected and through our journey of exploration we can become very connected again, but objectively? 

Early function of music have been to unite people. Geland monkeys use music as a shared experience to solve conflicts. They sing together, like in a choir, they use an agreed pattern. 

" ... music became less important as a way of conveying information, but retained its significance as a way of communicating feelings and cementing bounds between individuals, especially in groups situations." [p23] 

#### Interesting:

Other culture's music could sound to use simple, however perhaps because we don't understand the system behind the compositions. We don't understand, because we got used to different systems. 

## II. Music, Brain and Body

"Music brings about similar physical responses in different people at the same time. ... Music has the effect of intensifying or underlining the emotion which a particular event calls forth, by simultaneously co-ordinating the emotions of a group of people." [p24] E.g. marching, working, funeral, dancing, .. 

Function can be arousal (excite), comfort (soothe), etc. 

CHECK! Why is there a closer relationship between hearing and emotional arousal, than seeing and emotional arousal? 

- "At an emotional level, there is something 'deeper' about hearing than seeing;" [p26]
- Perhaps hearing comes before seeing in the beginning of our lives (embryo); 

CHECK! How did hearing and seeing evolve in animals? 

"A dark world is frightening. Nightmares and infantile fears coalesce with rational anxieties when we come home at night through unlit streets. But a silent world is more terrifying. Is no one there nothing going on at all?" [p27]

"Human being suffer from stimulus hunger as well as stimulus overload; ..."

"Music structures time." [p30]

### Language and music
Language is processed in the left hemisphere (logic). 
Music is processed in the right hemisphere (emotion).
The devision is not based on words vs. music, but on logic vs. emotion. 

Poetry operates the right hemisphere as well (as it is emotional). 

CHECK! [lateralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function) and animal brain lateralization. 

"Perhaps emotional response to music is chiefly centred in the right hemisphere, whilst executive skills and critical analysis are functions of the left hemisphere." [p38]

Musical form is intellectually processed (left), music's expressive content is emotionally processed (right). 

CHECK! Is there a relationship between these processes and meditation types? 

He writes about his mescaline use for music research:

"My reaction to mescaline convinced me that, in my own case, the part of the brain concerned with emotional responses is different from the part which perceives structure. ... The appreciation of music requires both parts, although either may predominate on a particular occasion." [p40]

"...anything which increases our feeling of being securely balanced and in control of our movements enhances our sense of well-being. ... Music can order our muscular system. I believe that it is also able to order our mental contents. [p41]

#### Interesting

- We hear music better in our left ear (as the left ear is connected to the right hemisphere). 
- Greeks didn't allow all modes (scales) to be used for compositions. [p42]
- Physiology of anger, fear and sex are similar. 

## III. Basic Patterns

"...music is an art deeply rooted in human nature, but not closely connected with the external world. ... Although music is sometimes referred to as a universal language, this is an entirely misleading description." [p49]

"I shall argue that music originates from the human brain rather than from the natural world." [p51]

The octave is a natural (mathematical) fact, but when subdivisions are made we [might] not follow rules of nature any more. 

Talks about Pythagoras, ...

" A tonal work must begin by implying the central position of the tonic, and it must end with it; therefore everything that follows the opening and precedes the final tonic may be conceived as dissonant in relation to the tonic triad, the only perfect consonance." ~ Charles Rosen, Schoenberg [p55]

History changes what people think is dissonant and consonant when it comes to the devisions, ... [p56]

### Harmonic series and tonal systems
Some say they are closely related, Storr doesn't agree. 

"Above all it seems to me clear that physics and music are different spheres, and that, though they certainly touch at moments, the connection between them is an occasional and circumstantial, not an essential, one."~Roger Sessions [p63]

"Music can best be understood as a system or relationships between tones, just as language is a system of relationships between words. There are many varieties of music, just as there are many languages. We do not need to relate music to some features of the external world in an effort to demonstrate its fundamental importance. ... What we need to consider is not nature, but human nature. ... The universality of music depends upon basic characteristics of the human mind; especially upon the need to impose order upon our experience." [p64] 



[CHECK] The ratios in the harmonic series. 

Timbre: the volume of the overtones changes the sound. 


### Interesting
"... the bulldozer effect of Western dominance, which tends to destroy every indigenous aspect of the cultures with which it comes into contact... " people think Western music is also superior.  

"The words 'natural' and 'nature' have inescapable associations of 'better' which are widely exploited by advertisers. [p63]

## IV. Songs Without Words

" Early music instruments were melodic imitations of the human voice; and it took centuries to establish music as a series of sounds unrelated to the voice and detached from any verbal association." [p66] 

"..., but our forefathers who learnt to appreciate music without voices were the real discoverers, opening up new artistic fields of which we cannot yet gauge the limits." ~George Dyson [p66] 

When [instrumental] music is only to listened to (not dance, rituals, celebrations), people in the audience listen more individually and therefore their experiences are more individual, different as well. You don't really know what you audience is feeling. Same music can arouse difference emotions to the same person in different situations. 


Can we agree with this? Is there absolute music? 

"..., a listener's response to a particular piece of music is governed by his subjective state of mind at the time; and some part of his experience is likely to be derived from the projection of his own emotions rather than being solely a direct consequence of this music." [p70] 

"...,  I wonder whether music might not be the unique example of what might have been - if the invention of language, the formation of words, the analysis of ideas had not intervened - the means of communication between souls." ~Proust [p71]

"Critics may agree that a particular work of art is 'significant' because they find themselves moved and interested; and are likely to agree in general terms about whether a work is tragic, humours, profound or superficial. But detailed, specific descriptions of their subjective reactions may differ considerably." [p71]

semantic ambiguity

"Music cannot express the composer's feelings... Here is what he really does: he knows by experience that certain patterns of tone settings corresponds with certain emotional reactions on the listener's part. Writing the patterns frequently and finding his observations confirmed, in anticipating the listener's reaction he believes himself to be in the same mental situation." ~Hindemith [p75]

Can music only recall feelings we have experience before or can it also "present emotions and moods we have not felt" before? 

Barzum claims "(1) that all music is programmatic, explicitly or implicitly, and in more than one way; (2) that keeping out all extraneous ideas or perceptions while composing, hearing, or analysing music is impossible and unnecessary, and (3) that musical people who call literary the elements or the influence they deprecate in music do not fully understand what literature is. [p80]

Hero and adventure theme (ABA') - returning home (tonic) with more skills, experience... 

Sense of identity [p83]

"Music activates tendencies, inhibits them, and provides meaningful and relevant resolutions." ~ Leonard Meyer [p84] CHECK

Awareness can be achieved by surprising the listening. [p85] 
K: This is in line with Jeff Strong's methods. Also, by delaying closure. 

" ... appreciation of both form and emotional significance enter into the experience of every listener and cannot be separated."

k: good argument for algorithmic music being an option to explore to keep attention. 

"Form and content in music and body and soul in human beings are equally invisible if either are to live." [p88] ? k: Perhaps he means the relationship between them is invisible.



### Interesting
**Absolute music**  
Some say absolute music (which is instrumental - I guess meaning without words more then without voice) doesn't refer to anything outside itself. In other words it is not like funeral music where the music should function to enhance a mood. 


### V. Escape from Reality

He disagrees with the idea that music is a substitute, an escape from real life. 

Mentions Freud (who didn't like music) and disagrees with him in many points. 

"feeling as if something limitless, unbounded - as it were, "oceanic". [p95] Is this mindfulness vs trance? 

"I think it is important to distinguish between the experience of high arousal and the oceanic state which may occasionally *follow* an intense emotional experience. Both high arousal and the oceanic state are sometimes loosely miscalled 'ecstatic', but excitement is not the same as the oceanic experience, which is usually deemed tranquil." [p95]

Philosophers have thought about how music helps accessing other worlds. [p98]

This is how music can add to our knowledge?:  
"Freud's pejorative view of phantasy is incomplete rather than wholly wrong. Day-dreams are sometimes escapist as Freud suggests, but they can also be precursors of creative discovery and thus of new ways of adapting to reality. Like the other arts, music can provide a temporary retreat from the pains of existence, but this is only one of its functions, and by no means the most important. Music can also aid our adaptation to life in a variety of ways hinted in earlier chapters, but not yet fully explored." [98]

As the planter, countries, maps have been discovered, composers turn to sci-fi (music of the spheres). 

"As Stravinsky said, once a composition is finished, it exists as something in its own right. This is why music is not a direct communication of the composers's feelings to his audience, but rather a communication about how he makes sense of his feelings, gives them structure, transforms them from raw emotions into art." [p100]

Creative vs mentally ill

The creatives are good at dealing with the threat the external words confusion and disorder provides - they can organise it. :)
