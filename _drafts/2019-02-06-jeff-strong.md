- how do BPMs fit with the entrainment reagee to drum and bass;
- theta state, alpha state - is there a state where there is both or more present and perhaps there is an EEG shape;
- who is his second teacher (the shaman drummer?)
- Buddhist monks can go in deep theta and high delta (REF?)
- First time journey with shamanic drumming should take 7-12 minutes (REF)
- How to go in the lower and the upper world?
- trance music and trance drumming? what is the relationship?
- make a diagram that shows 0 - 14 hz, devides it into brain rhythms, and illustrates what these brainwaves are for, more internal, more external, more self, less self, ... << not black and white, it's like jin and jang >>>
- Hi Jeff. What difficulties can we face when drumming in our heads [internally] in order to shift awareness - similarly to how you do with the REI program/drum healing?﻿

## summary

In connection to the two neuroMeditation techniques investigated in my PhD I have investigated the work of Jeff Strong.

1) steady pattern (entrainment)
- the main groove;
- auditory driving;
- entrainment;

+  
2) accents & orchestration for a rhythm (engaging on top)
- "nervous system is always trying to decipher it"
- stimulating the brain with an unpredictable pattern;
- more work to figure out = higher stimulation;
- at around 6 we need to add some groove;
- higher, we need to add more variations;
- same temp, same rhythm with some accents is already more complex;
- think about [polymetre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQa6q4nxU) (polymetre vs polyrhythm (https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/10488/polymeter-vs-polyrhythm)?)

3) ambient sounds
- why are there ambient sounds? does drumming overstimulate? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6hu6oXaau8  It tones down the intensitity of the drumming.

6 BPS = mid-theta

- [Compares Brainwave Entrainment Techniques: Drumming vs Binaural Beats](https://youtu.be/tkvomej7R0Q)
- traditional healing is between 4-8 BPS
- drumming are more effective because
  - 1) you don't need headphones;
  - 2) too repetitive in higher end (8 BPS) will become boring and the mind will wander - in lower BPS (4 BPS) is OK as it is a more inward facing awareness and the senses eyes, ears are not as much used;
  - 3) even with low BPS is varied as the acoustic sound is always a bit different, some binaural beat soundtracks have music, nature sounds which makes it a bit better

- "your brain will decipher the pattern and will develop a tolerance to it" - "drumming is infinitely variable",
- **steady pattern (entrainment) + accents & orchestration for a rhythm (engaging on top)**;
- we are used to so much stimulus that we can get easily bored;
- musicality, interesting, not annoying, variability, "the ability of the brain to stay engaged through unpredictability".
- you don't need headphones with drumming ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Q5mKVEi0k))

- slow tempo can be more repetitive;
- fast tempo needs to have more unpredictability;

- they play in theta (between 4-8 BPS)
- 4 BPS visualisation, journeys,
- 6.5 - 7 BPS: mid theta (ceremonial drumming), you can keep it steady, you are not processing what you are hearing, the slower the tempo to more repetitive your tempo can be; here you can experiment with less repetitiveness;
- 8 BPS: needs to be more varied (alpha) alert but still relaxed; optimal place, the custom program (REI) started with traditional rhythms;
- key: odd meters;
- drums are playing quietly in the background, we are stimulating the brain, drumming is in the background, we are thinking about other things, we are not thinking about the drums, ...

## Drum Healing Training Program

### pre1 How and When to Listen to Your REI Custom Program
- low volume, in the background (don't really notice it - sufficient)
- do I actively need to listen? no;
- do we need to listen to all the way through?

### pre2 Welcome To The Drum Healing Training Program
- which drum to buy? 16'' Remo Frame drum;

### pre3 Pre-program: Intro to Drums
- introduces frame drums, suggestion is synthetic skin that is played with the fingers;
- frame drum: lap style and 'tar' style holding;
- djembey:

### pre4 Understanding Music Notation
- BASS TONE (dum) - the lowest tone in the middle of drum;
- OPEN TONE (tek - tak) - on the side of the drum;
- SLAP TONE () - 'chocking of the head' - holding the fingers on the drum;
- MUTED TONE (ghost note) - quiet, goes underneath, pattern,
// playing the mute notes is important, **we play the muted tones in this course (all the beats)**

With triplets (12/8) we are alternative the downbeats between left and right hand.

### week01
#### video 1 - intro;
#### video 2 - An Exploration of Drum Healing
> This session explores drum healing around the world. It offers an overview of the different techniques used and how they relate to the brain. With a healthy dose of my background with Shango, Shamanism, and connection thrown in.

history: first instruments beating on drums, later with membrane, the rhythm is more important than the tone, how do the variations of rhythm actually do?, the right rhythm in the right order in ceremonial drumming to call spirits, tribes hid their spirits in catholic saints; shamanism around the world has same rhythms (has been the same form centuries - 4hz constant beat) - jeff says if it is everywhere so there must be true; the difference between hallucinogenics and drumming is that drumming you can control, you can change it slightly, you can stop if you want to; the underlying pattern is what you need to sync to; earlier people where training to the heartbeat with 60BPM (no literature that the heart entrains to any music CHECK - it's only a relaxation response, but this is not entrainment, drumming and brainwaves is); talks about 8 BPS is calming as it entrains alpha;

- the underlying tempo of the music is what is used for entrainment;
- stimulation is the specificity of the rhythm, how much is the brain working on it, if more complex the brain works more;
- the get to a state (Where the healing spirit is), we have to go through different rhythms, (rhythm1 > rhythm2 > ... same tempo)
- rhythm is grouping of soft and laud notes, how these notes relate to each other;
- this is not an REI course, it would be too complex to learn all the rhythms;
- Jeff takes a traditional ryhthm (samba) and puts it into an odd meter (4/4 > 7/8, last two beats are cut of, 16/8 to 15/8 pattern), he did this because autistic people were 'bored' by 4/4, ...
- first he took out the sacred aspect, later he put it back (chakras and spirits);

? find an academic reference to what delta, theta, alpha, beta really are;
? he talks about theta states, alpha states, etc. but he doesn't mention having e.g. both theta and gamma, etc.

- when going slow in 4/4 there should be a bigger volume difference between the open and the muted note. When played this faster the difference between the volume doesn't need to be that big.

### week02
#### 1 Intro to Shamanic Drumming

The goal is to go in an altered state of consciousness without drugs. The drumming is better as it is more controlled. Shamanic journeys is different to trance drumming. Shaman uses this altered state of consciousness to help someone. You go in this altered state (journey) to 1. ask a question about herbs, 2. to do the healing within the journey, by connecting to something (spirit).

4BPS (aware of own minds, our normal senses are subdued, other senses are heightened)

Buddhist monks can go in deep theta and high delta (REF?)

The drum aids meditation, it helps clear the mind. With meditation in silence it is more difficult to quieten the mind from worries, thoughts.

First time journey with shamanic drumming should take 7-12 minutes (REF)
In later journeys you can get into 'theta' faster.

? How to go in the lower and the upper world?

OEB/Astral Projection is different - Jeff says they are not for healing. (?)

Shamanic Drumming is 40,000 years old.


### week02
#### 2 A Shamanic Journey to Connect with a Spirit Helper
The idea is to help the spirit animal, spirit helper. Go into the lower world through a portal. Through a lake, bark of tree, enter a cave, steps. This lower world look like for many people like a forest, but could look different as well.

### Week 3 video 1
Trance drumming has some more variability than shamanic drumming. Maybe it has the same tempo, but the rhythm changes. Many times dance go with it. The tempo can be between 2 - 8hz. A lot of odd meter. As with the shamanic journeying we need at least 10 minutes for an effect, with trance drumming at least 5 minutes. Here with Jeff it's a little bit faster than shamanic drumming. Theta is an internally directed, here is healing, therapy happening. Intuition, creative, problem solving.

Some people don't play the muted tones. Jeff likes to include them, because it helps to create the pattern.

Most basic pattern:

200 1010 100
RLL RLRL RLL

* may seem boring, but it's not;
* don't change the tempo and the rhythm much;
* It needs to be repetitive;
* stick to the pattern for 5-10 minutes, for max 6bps;

### Week 3 Community and Ceremonial Drumming
- most healing drumming uses theta, sometimes they go into alpha a bit, but not for long, usually mid theta;
- in a healing ceremony, you need to get the cool/heat balance right; if it's too hot, people get possessed.
- archetypes of certain spirits;
- start cool, add 'orchestration' i.e. different notes, later some more variety;
