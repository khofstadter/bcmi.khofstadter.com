## summary

In connection to the two neuroMeditation techniques investigated in my PhD I have investigated the work of Jeff Strong.

1) steady pattern (entrainment)
- the main groove;
- auditory driving;
- entrainment;


+  
2) accents & orchestration for a rhythm (engaging on top)
- "nervous system is always trying to decipher it"
- stimulating the brain with an unpredictable pattern;
- more work to figure out = higher stimulation;
- at around 6 we need to add some groove;
- higher, we need to add more variations;
- same temp, same rhythm with some accents is already more complex;
- think about [polymetre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTQa6q4nxU) (polymetre vs polyrhythm?)

beat per second (BPS)= Herz in EEG   
6 BPS = mid-theta

- traditional healing is between 4-8 BPS
- drumming are more effective because
  - 1) you don't need headphones;
  - 2) too repetitive in higher end (8 BPS) will become boring and the mind will wander - in lower BPS (4 BPS) is OK as it is a more inward facing awareness and the senses eyes, ears are not as much used;
  - 3) even with low BPS is varied as the acoustic sound is always a bit different, some binaural beat soundtracks have music, nature sounds which makes it a bit better

- "your brain will decipher the pattern and will develop a tolerance to it" - "drumming is infinitely variable",
- **steady pattern (entrainment) + accents & orchestration for a rhythm (engaging on top)**;
- we are used to so much stimulus that we can get easily bored;
- musicality, interesting, not annoying, variability, "the ability of the brain to stay engaged through unpredictability".
- you don't need headphones with drumming ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Q5mKVEi0k))

- slow tempo can be more repetitive;
- fast tempo needs to have more unpredictability;

- they play in theta (between 4-8 BPS)
- 4 BPS visualisation, journeys,
- 6.5 - 7 BPS: mid theta (ceremonial drumming), you can keep it steady, you are not processing what you are hearing, the slower the tempo to more repetitive your tempo can be; here you can experiment with less repetitiveness;
- 8 BPS: needs to be more varied (alpha) alert but still relaxed; optimal place, the custom program (REI) started with traditional rhythms;
- key: odd meters;
- drums are playing quietly in the background, we are stimulating the brain, drumming is in the background, we are thinking about other things, we are not thinking about the drums, ...

- same rhythm 4 BPS (traditional shamanic technique)
- mid theta: (trance drumming)

- ideally we should listen to our real background sounds as well - refine this;

- low stimulation (not much variety)
- high stimulation (more variety)
