Hello, my name is Krisztián Hofstädter. This website archives my work and interest in relation to Brain Computer Music Interfacing. I'm currently doing a PhD in Music at the Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge. Abstract:
<br><br>
This interdisciplinary, practice-based research develops a Brain-Computer Music Interface (BCMI) which reinforces brainwave patterns linked to meditative states of mind by giving auditory feedback. The proposed BCMI software employs the therapeutic benefits of neurofeedback (NF), gaming, music and meditation in order to be effective in helping users understand their cognition. The software’s effectiveness is investigated in training programmes and demonstrated in presentations and concerts with consumer-graded electroencephalography (EEG).
