Hello, my name is Krisztián Hofstädter. This subdomain archives my doctoral research at the [ARU](https://aru.ac.uk/), Cambridge.

## abstract

This interdisciplinary research developed a brain-computer music interface and demonstrated its use for scientific and artistic purposes. It was developed for neurofeedback practitioners and creatives interested in the combined use of brain-computer interfacing and music for well-being and creative expressions linked to meditation. Its effectiveness is investigated in training programmes, surveys and demonstrated in presentations and performances with real-time electroencephalography (EEG).
