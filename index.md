_PhD abstract:_
<br>
This interdisciplinary, practice-based research develops a Brain-Computer Music Interface (BCMI) which reinforces brainwave patterns linked to meditative states of mind by giving auditory feedback. The proposed BCMI software employs the therapeutic benefits of neurofeedback (NF), gaming, music and meditation in order to be effective in helping users understand their cognition. The software’s effectiveness is investigated in training programmes and demonstrated in presentations and concerts with consumer-graded electroencephalography (EEG).
