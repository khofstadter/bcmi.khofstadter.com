<ul>
  <li>test distance;</li>
  <li>test direct connection;
// look for issue on GitHub and Forum;</li>

  <li>need to find a way to use ear-clips for REF with y cable;</li>
  <li>experimented with positioning the board and cables next to me on a chair to reduce 50hz noise and reduce impedance: all worked out;</li>
  <li>for the last few weeks I have been pre-soaking the electrode shells and sponges for around 30 mintutes, when I add them to the cap, they are very wet - seems to help;</li>
