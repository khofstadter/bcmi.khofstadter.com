This project uses the [OpenBCI-SuperCollider Interface](/ibva-supercollider-interface/) to read EEG data while listening to

1. music by [<kbd>Andrej Hvatin</kbd>](https://nimetu.org/);
2. binaural beats from [Monroe Institute](https://www.monroeinstitute.org/) and
3. my own frame drumming.

After recording sessions, subconscious 'visions' are interpreted in drawings and audio recordings. EEG data is analyses in SuperCollider.
