I use our [OpenBCI-SuperCollider Interface](/ibva-supercollider-interface/) to read EEG data while listening to music by [<kbd>Andrej Hvatin</kbd>](https://nimetu.org/) and binaural beats from [Monroe Institute](https://www.monroeinstitute.org/). After readings, 'visions' are often interpreted in drawings and audio recordings. EEG data is analyses in SuperCollider.
