short: A few ongoing experiments with the OpenBCI-SuperCollider Interface, where music is only used as an input for the brain i.e. there is no neurofeedback circle involved.

These projects use the [OpenBCI-SuperCollider Interface](/ibva-supercollider-interface/) to read EEG data while listening to

- [MONOLIT](https://nimetu.bandcamp.com/album/monolit) by [<kbd>Andrej Hrvatin</kbd>](https://nimetu.org/)

- binaural beats designed by Robert Monroe including [The Gateway Experience](https://www.thegatewayexperience.com/wave-i-discovery-3-cd-set/) and

- my own (live or prerecorded) frame drumming while shamanic journeying (meditating).

After recording sessions, internal visual imageries (visions) are interpreted in drawings. EEG data is currently analysed in SuperCollider only, but is planned to be analysed in Matlab as well.

To clarify, in contrast to several other projects in this research, the above projects here do not use neurofeedback, they only record EEG activity while listening to music to be analysed later (offline).
