short: I made a music video for a Cambridge Pint of Science event. The idea was to reflect on my 'caffeine and music addiction'.

The exhibited audio-music piece titled 'compulsive music waves' is my reflection on [Dr David Belin](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?davidbelin)â€™s work on addictions.

> Sometimes I feel addicted to drinking a certain type of tea and making a certain type of music: PuErh tea and electronic music.

The video below records a morning tea ceremony with a mobile phone attached to my forehead. After the video recording, the music was composed with the flextime sequencer developed for [BCMI-1](/neurosky-supercollider-interface-and-audio-neurogame/).
