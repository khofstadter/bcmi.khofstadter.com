short: I made a music video for a Pint of Science event at Cambridge. The idea was to reflect on addiction, in this case my caffeine and music addiction.

The exhibited audio-music piece titled 'compulsive music waves' is my reflection on [Dr David Belin](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?davidbelin)â€™s work on addictions.

> Sometimes I feel addicted to a certain type of tea and the making of monotone music.

The video records a morning tea ceremony with a mobile phone stabilised to my forehead. The music was composed afterwards in real-time with an algorithmic sequencer developed for [one of the brain-computer music interfaces](/neurosky-supercollider-interface-and-audio-neurogame/) in this doctoral research.
