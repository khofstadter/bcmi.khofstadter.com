This project developed a software that interfaces [<kbd>NeuroSky</kbd>](http://neurosky.com/) EEG headbands with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) in the context of an audio neurogame. The goal of the project was to create a neurofeedback tool where the audio feedback (rewards) are embedded in an immersive sonic environment which can help facilitate the desired mental shift.
