>This study compares the effects of two versions of a soundscape. The goal of the soundscape is to help create and maintain an altered state of consciousness, a deep meditative state characterised by strong theta brainwaves. The brainwave entrainment in the original version of the soundscape relies on the method of sonic driving in traditional shamanic journeys and the method of rhythmic entrainment in the works of Jeff Strong. In addition to these methods, the alternative version also features binaural beats pulsating in sync with the tempo of the drumming. You will be randomly selected one version to listen to.

<br>
Both versions of the soundscape can be found on the ['shamanic soundscape - level two' release](/shamanic-soundscape-level-two/).

All data in .csv formats will uploaded anonymously to GitHub.
<br><br>
A short overview of the analysis will be presented as part of the PhD commentary, in _project_c_. More detailed analysis will be presented later in a separate publication.

The data from the shamanic meditation survey (n=27) is currently being analysed with [RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/).
