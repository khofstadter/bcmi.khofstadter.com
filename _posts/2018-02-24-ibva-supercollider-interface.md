In 2018 [Fredik Olofsson](https://fredrikolofsson.com/) was added as an external advisor to the supervisory team. He introduced me to [GitHub](https://github.com/) while making a SuperCollider class that acquires raw EEG signals from the 2 channel IBVA (BlueVAS) EEG hardware. I have tested this interface, and other devices e.g. NeuroSky and Emotiv to find the most suitable EEG for the research. This year I decided to pause the development of this interface to be able to focus on developing the [<kbd>OpenBCI-SuperCollider</kbd>](/openbci-supercollider-interface/) interface with Fredik.
