This project merges the analysis of the two previous listening studies ([1](/listening-study-2/),[2](/listening-study-1/)) and uses [RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) to produce aesthetically pleasing and meaningful visual representation of data correlations and (possible) causal relations.

Some insights from the first listening study will be disclosed in the PhD commentary. The completed project is planned to be published as an academic journal paper related to altered states of consciousness and music.
