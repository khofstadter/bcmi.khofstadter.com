short: First onling survey testing a shamanic soundscape with auditory entrainment.
---
> This survey attempts to collect effects of a soundscape for meditation supported by sonic driving. The sonic driving derives from the shamanic journey tradition, but is not specifically a shamanic journey. The estimated completion time is 30 minutes, including a 20 minute meditation.

The soundscape tested the piece'jester', which can be found on the ['shamanic soundscape - level two' release](/shamanic-soundscape-level-two/).

A short overview of the analysis is presented as part of the PhD commentary. More detailed analysis will be presented later in a separate publication.
