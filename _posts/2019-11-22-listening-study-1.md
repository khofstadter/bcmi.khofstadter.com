> This survey attempts to collect effects of a soundscape for meditation supported by sonic driving. The sonic driving derives from the shamanic journey tradition, but is not specifically a shamanic journey. The estimated completion time is 30 minutes, including a 20 minute meditation.

The soundscape tested, 'jester' can be found on the ['shamanic soundscape - level two' release](/shamanic-soundscape-level-two/).

<br><br>
A short overview of the analysis will be presented as part of the PhD commentary, in _project_c_. More detailed analysis will be presented later in a separate publication.
