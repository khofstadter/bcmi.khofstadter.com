Gave a presentation at [Kelcy Davenport](http://www.kelcydavenport.com/)'s ‘[The Archive and the Contested Landscape](https://thearchiveandthecontestedlandscape.wordpress.com/)' symposium, which was part of the 2018 [Festival of Ideas](https://www.festivalofideas.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge. The presentation focused on the relationship between the key ideas behind the event and my BCMI reseach.
