This release contains audio recordings made with the sequencer developed for the [NeuroSky-SuperCollider Interface](/neurosky-supercollider-interface-and-audio-neurogame/) (BCMI-1).

In contrast to the [first CMW complication](/compulsive-music-waves-i/), CMW_ii contains much longer (~30 min) compositions with sustained repetitions. The primary goal with these compositions was to create a sustained sound texture that is monotone enough to help me focus while writing up the research in the PhD commentary, however also features unpredictable (random) variations to (somehow) help my brain to stay alert.
